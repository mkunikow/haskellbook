# Exercises: Understanding Folds

1. `foldr (*) 1 [1..5]` will return the same result as which of the following:

* a) `flip (*) 1 [1..5]`
* **b)** `foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..5]`
* **c)** `foldl (*) 1 [1..5]`

2. Write out the evaluation steps for `foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]`

```haskell
foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3] = foldl (*) 1 [1..3]

((1 * 1) * 2) *3

((1) * 2) *3
(2) *3
6

```

3. One difference between foldr and foldl is:

* a) foldr, but not foldl, traverses the spine of a list from right
to left
* b) foldr, but not foldl, always forces the rest of the fold
* **c)** foldr, but not foldl, associates to the right
* d) foldr, but not foldl, is recursive


4. Folds are catamorphisms, which means they are generally used to
* **a)** reduce structure
* b) expand structure
* c) render you catatonic
* d) generate infinite data structures


5. The following are simple folds very similar to what youâ€™ve al- ready seen, but each has at least one error. Please fix them and test in your REPL:
* a) `foldr (++) ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]` -> `foldr (++) "" ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]`
* b) `foldr max [] "fear is the little death"` -> `foldr max ' ' "fear is the little death"`
* c) `foldr and True [False, True]` -> `foldr (&&) True [False, True]`
* d) This one is more subtle than the previous. Can it ever return a different answer? 
`foldr (||) True [False, True]` -> Always true
* e) `foldl ((++) . show) "" [1..5`] -> `foldl (flip $ (++) . show) "" [1..5]`
* f) `foldr const 'a' [1..5]` -> ``foldr (flip const) 'a' [1..5]``
* g) `foldr const 0 "tacos"` -> ``foldr (flip const) 0 "tacos"``
* h) `foldl (flip const) 0 "burritos"` -> `foldl const 0 "burritos"`
* i) `foldl (flip const) 'z' [1..5]` -> `foldl const 'z' [1..5]`
