# Exercises: Grab Bag

Note the following exercises are from source code files, not written
for use directly in the REPL. Of course, you can change them to test
directly in the REPL if you prefer.

1. Which (two or more) of the following are equivalent?
   * a) `mTh x y z = x * y * z`
   * b) `mTh x y = \z -> x * y * z`
   * c) `mTh x = \y -> \z -> x * y * z`
   * d) `mTh = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z`
   
   Answear:

   a) == b) == c) == d)

2. The type of mTh (above) is `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`.
Which is the type of mTh 3?
   * a) `Integer -> Integer -> Integer`
   * b) `Num a => a -> a -> a -> a`
   * c) `Num a => a -> a`
   * **d)** `Num a => a -> a -> a`

3. Next, we’ll practice writing anonymous lambda syntax.
For example, one could rewrite:

   `addOne x = x + 1`

   Into:

   `addOne = \x -> x + 1`

   Try to make it so it can still be loaded as a top-level definition
by GHCi. This will make it easier to validate your answers.

   * a) Rewrite the f function in the where clause.

   ```haskell   
   addOneIfOdd n = case odd n of
      True -> f n
      False -> n
      where f n = n + 1
   ```

   ```haskell
   addOneIfOddLamda n = case odd n of
      True -> f n
      False -> n
      where f = \n -> n + 1
   ```

   * b) Rewrite the following to use anonymous lambda syntax:

   ```haskell
   addFive x y = (if x > y then y else x) + 5
   ```

   ```haskell
   addFiveLamda = \x -> \y -> (if x > y then y else x) + 5
   ```

   * c) Rewrite the following so that it doesn’t use anonymous
lambda syntax:

   ```haskell
   mflip f = \x -> \y -> f y x
   ```

   ```haskell
   mflipNoLamda f x y = f y x 
   ```
