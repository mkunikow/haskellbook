# 1. For the following lines of code, read the syntax carefully and
decide if they are written correctly. Test them in your REPL
after youâ€™ve decided to check your work. Correct as many as
you can.


a) concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] -> OK
b) ++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] -> (++) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
c) (++) "hello" " world" -> OK
d) ["hello" ++ " world] -> OK
e) 4 !! "hello" -> "hello" !! 4
f) (!!) "hello" 4 -> OK
g) take "4 lovely" -> take 4 "lovely"
h) take 3 "awesome" -> OK

# 2. Next we have two sets: the first set is lines of code and the other
is a set of results. Read the code and figure out which results
came from which lines of code. Be sure to test them in the
REPL.

a) concat [[1 * 6], [2 * 6], [3 * 6]] -> d) [6,12,18]
b) "rain" ++ drop 2 "elbow" -> c) "rainbow"
c) 10 * head [1, 2, 3] -> e) 10
d) (take 3 "Julie") ++ (tail "yes") -> a) "Jules"
e) concat [tail [1, 2, 3], tail [4, 5, 6], tail [7, 8, 9]] -> b) [2,3,5,6,8,9]
