# Intermission: Exercise

Write out the evaluation of the following. It might be a little less
noisy if you do so with the form that didnâ€™t use `(.).`

```haskell
applyTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> (b -> b) -> b -> b
applyTimes 0 f b = b
applyTimes n f b = f . applyTimes (n-1) f $ b
applyTimes n f b = f (applyTimes (n-1) f b)

```

```haskell
applyTimes 5 (+1) 5 = 

    (+1) (applyTimes 4 (+1) 5)
    (+1) ( (+1) (applyTimes 3 (+1) 5))
    (+1) ( (+1)((+1)(applyTimes 2 (+1) 5)))    
    (+1) ( (+1) ((+1)((+1)(applyTimes 1 (+1) 5))))
    (+1) ((+1)(+1(+1(+1(5)))))

    ==10

    (+1) . applyTimes 4 (+1) # 5
    ....

    (+1) . (+1) . (+1) . (+1) . (+1) $ 5
    

```

## Review of types

1. What is the type of `[[True, False], [True, True], [False, True]]`?
   * a) Bool
   * b) mostly True
   * c) [a]
   * **d)** [[Bool]]

2. Which of the following has the same type as `[[True, False], [True, True], [False, True]]`?
   * a) [(True, False), (True, True), (False, True)]
   * **b)** [[3 == 3], [6 > 5], [3 < 4]]
   * c) [3 == 3, 6 > 5, 3 < 4] 
   * d) ["Bool", "more Bool", "Booly Bool!"]
3. For the following function

```haskell
func :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
func x y = x ++ y
```

which of the following is true?

   * **a)** x and y must be of the same type
   * **b)** x and y must both be lists
   * **c)** if x is a String then y must be a String
   * **d)** all of the above

4. For the func code above, which is a valid application of func to
both of its arguments?

   * a) func "Hello World"
   * **b)** func "Hello" "World"
   * c) func [1, 2, 3] "a, b, c"
   * d) func ["Hello", "World"]

## Reviewing currying

Given the following definitions, tell us what value results from further
applications.

```haskell
cattyConny :: String -> String -> String
cattyConny x y = x ++ " mrow " ++ y
-- fill in the types
flippy :: String -> String -> String
flippy = flip cattyConny

appendCatty :: String -> String
appedCatty = cattyConny "woops"

frappe :: String -> String
frappe = flippy "haha"
```

What is the value of
1. `appedCatty "woohoo!"` -> "woops mrow woohoo!"
2. `frappe "1"`           -> "1 mrow haha"
3. `frappe (appedCatty "2")` -> "woops mrow 2 mrow haha"
4. `appedCatty (frappe "blue")` -> "woops mrow  blue mrow haha"
5. `cattyConny (frappe "pink") (cattyConny "green" (appedCatty "blue"))` -> "pink mrow haha mrow green mrow woops mrow blue"
6. `cattyConny (flippy "Pugs" "are") "awesome"` -> "are mrow Pugs mrow awesome"


## Recursion

1. Write out the steps for reducing dividedBy 15 2 to its final answer
according to the Haskell code.

```haskell
dividedBy :: Integral a => a -> a -> (a, a)
dividedBy num denom = go num denom 0
where go n
 d count
| n < d = (count, n)
| otherwise = go (n - d) d (count + 1)

dividedBy 15 2 =
go 15 2 0

| 15 < 2 ...
-- false, skip this branch

| otherwise = go (15 - 2) 2 (0 + 1)

go 13 2 1

go (13 -2) 2 (1 + 1)
go 11 2 2


go (11 -2) 2 (2 + 1)
go 9 2 3


go (9 -2) 2 (3 + 1)
go 7 2 4


go (7 -2) 2 (4 + 1)
go 5 2 5

go (5 -2) 2 (5 + 1)
go 3 2 6


go (3 -2) 2 (6 + 1)
go 1 2 7

| 1 < 2 = (7, 1)
