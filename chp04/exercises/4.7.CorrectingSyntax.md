Correcting syntax
In the following examples, you’ll be shown syntactically incorrect
code. Type it in and try to correct it in your text editor, validating it
with GHC or GHCi.

1. Here, we want a function that adds 1 to the length of a string
argument and returns that result.

```
x = (+)
F xs = w 'x' 1
where w = length xs
```

Fix:

```
x = (+)
let f xs = x w 1 where w = length xs
```

2. This is supposed to be the identity function, id.

```
\ X = x
```

Fix

```
\x -> x
```


3. When fixed, this function will return 1 from the value [1, 2, 3].
Hint: you may need to refer back to the section about variables
conventions in “Hello Haskell” to refresh your memory of this
notation.

```
\ x : xs -> x
```

Fix

```
\ (x : xs) -> x
```

4. When fixed, this function will return 1 from the value (1, 2).

```
f (a b) = A
```

Fix

```
f (a, b) = a
```
